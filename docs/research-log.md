# Research log

One entry per working session. Keep it honest: what I tried, what actually happened
(numbers, errors), what I concluded, what's next. This log is the raw material for
weekly public posts — write it so a stranger could follow it.

## 2026-08-27 — Day 0: workspace setup

**Did:** Set up the repo, uv environment, LeRobot install, and the Phase 0 eval script.
Wrote the roadmap.

**Next:** Run `scripts/00_eval_pretrained.py` to get my first self-produced success-rate
number. Then paper note #1: RoboMemArena.

**Post idea:** "Day 0 of building the memory layer for robots — here's the plan."

## 2026-08-27 — Day 0, part 2: the normalization bug

**Did:** First eval of `lerobot/diffusion_pusht` on PushT: **0% success over 5 episodes**,
best reward ~0.03. A pretrained policy should get ~60%+.

**Debugging trail (keep this format — it's the post):**
1. Suspected my observation formatting → printed shapes: env gives (96, 96, 3) pixels +
   2-dim state, policy expects exactly that. Not it.
2. Suspected MPS (Apple GPU) numerics → same observation on CPU and MPS gave nearly the
   same action. Not it. But the action VALUE was the clue: `[0.85, 1.0]` — PushT wants
   pixel coordinates in [0, 512]. The policy was outputting *normalized* actions, so the
   agent was pinned into a corner every step.
3. Root cause: the checkpoint is old-format — its normalization stats live inside
   `model.safetensors` under keys like `normalize_inputs.buffer_observation_state.min`.
   LeRobot 0.6 moved normalization out of the policy into processor pipelines, so
   `from_pretrained` drops those buffers with only a log warning
   ("Unexpected key(s) when loading model"). Garbage in (raw pixels where the net expects
   [-1,1]), garbage out (actions never scaled back to pixel space).

**Fix:** load the stats straight from the checkpoint file and apply them manually —
MIN_MAX → [-1, 1] for state/action (lerobot's convention, verified in
`processor/normalize_processor.py`), MEAN_STD for the image.

**Lesson:** silent normalization mismatches don't crash — they produce a policy that
"works" at 0%. Check the *units* of what goes in and comes out of a network before
suspecting anything deeper.

**Result after the fix: 60% success over 5 episodes (mean best reward 0.988), on MPS.**
Matches the checkpoint's reported ballpark. The two failures reached 0.96–0.98 coverage —
near-misses just under the 0.95-coverage success threshold, not blow-ups. First
self-produced eval number: Phase 0 milestone done. Video of episode 0 in
`outputs/rollout_ep0.mp4`.
